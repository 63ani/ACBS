## Theory

ACBS is powered by a valuation-based algorithm with a Minimax core, optimizing moves by evaluating piece values and positions. This sophisticated approach enables dynamic difficulty adjustments, making it suitable for various skill levels.

## Design

Featuring a blend of 3D-printed components and precision engineering, the ACBS design focuses on accuracy and efficiency. It employs NEMA17 stepper motors, DRV8825 drivers, and an ingenious system of limit switches and electromagnets for piece movement.

## Installation

Please refer to the detailed installation instructions provided on our GitHub repository to set up your ACBS.

## Usage

To start playing against the AI or watch the AI play against itself, follow the step-by-step guide on initializing the system and making moves.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you're interested in improving ACBS.
